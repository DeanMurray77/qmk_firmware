This is for the black keyboard, not the silver one.

I ran `qmk setup` from the root of the project


I ran `qmk compile -kb keebio/iris/rev8 -km DeanMurray77-rev8`
Then I had to connect the keyboard and hold down the resent for a second or so.
That caused the keyboard to show up as a storage device which I was able to drag the .uf2 file into.
